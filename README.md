First section is the intake, well first start off by creating a ticket as a user then recieving it as a help desk professional. First, go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and then click "Open a new ticket". Create a new ticket using the user account we created earlier. This user is reporting the mobile online banking is down. She is able to categorize this issue thanks to the help topics we added in the previous section.

After creating an agent account, log in using the credentials we set up earlier. Once logged in as jane.doe, the ticket we previously created will be visible. Click on the ticket to view its details and modify certain aspects if needed. For example, since the issue is affecting business operations, the ticket's priority can be changed to Emergency. Similarly, given the urgency of the issue, the SLA plan can be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the department in charge of addressing the problem should be escalated to the System Administrators.

When we make changes to the ticket, it is recorded in a thread as shown above.

Assuming that the issue has been resolved and the necessary documentation has been recorded, the ticket can now be marked as resolved and moved to the closed section. At this point, all systems should be functioning normally.
